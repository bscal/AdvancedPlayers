## Working On
***

* Switch over from Cardinal-Components to artemis ECS
* Unneeded files, or dependencies in gradle
* Work on custom entities
* Rename?
* Do we move stuff out to another library?
  * This seems good but really seasons and combat already are.
  * Archive healthy since it will basically be eaten by this project
  * Kinda just wanna make this out core and have mods implement their own things
  most needed things seems to be lightweight, but maintaining like 5 mods does
  not seem very fun
* Remove EventHub ECS and just use Fabrics events
  * Fabrics already builtin and seems to be better, besides the fact you need to register them
